# PRASUNET_DS_TASK1
This repository contains Python code to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using bar charts or histograms. Specifically, it demonstrates how to plot the distribution of ages and genders using sample data.

Requirements
Python (version >= 3.6)
Jupyter Notebook 
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Files Included:
PRASUNET_DS_TASK1.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing Python code to load sample data, clean and preprocess it (if necessary), and generate visualizations.
bank.csv: CSV file containing sample data with variables like ages and genders.

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially.
Modify the code to use your own dataset if desired 
Interpret the Results:
View the generated bar charts or histograms that visualize the distribution of ages or genders.
Analyze the patterns and insights from the visualizations.

Acknowledgments
Sample data used in this project is for demonstration purposes only and does not reflect real-world data.
Inspiration for this project came from practical data visualization tasks.
